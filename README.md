# PDFView

Xamarin.Forms(PCL) iOS/Android PDFView project

There are several ways to display pdf in Xamarin.Forms.
One of them is to use WebView, but it is not working well in android.
So I used pdf.js and custom renderer of webview to display PDF in android.

Xamarin.Forms(Shared) project will come soon.
